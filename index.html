  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is s-n-sharma. I am a undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) and Engineering Physics (EP).
    Currently, my interests are very broad; I think I am interested in almost each area of EECS. </p>

    <h3>Some things about me:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently, I mostly listen to (alternative/indie) rock, with my most-listened bands being The Strokes and Radiohead</li>
      <li>I also follow the NBA, and my favorite team is the Golden State Warriors. My favorite player is Stephen Curry, and I think that Lebron James is the GOAT.</li>
      <li>I like watching movies. Yes I like mainstream movies. No I have not watched an 8th-century Romanian movie filmed on a 3rd-century BCE pinhole camera. Some movies I like are:
        <ul>
          <li> Lord of the Rings</li>
          <li>The Dark Knight and Batman Begins</li>
          <li>Inception </li>
          <li>Interstellar</li>
          <li>Oppenheimer</li>
          <li>The Departed</li>
          <li>Inglourious Basterds</li>
          <li>Django Unchained</li>
          <li>The Usual Suspects</li>
          <li>The Godfather, both 1 and 2</li>
          <li>Top Gun: Maverick</li>
          <li>The Matrix</li>
          <li>Forrest Gump</li>
          <li>Goodfellas</li>
          <li>Gladiator</li>
          <li>Arrival</li>
          <li>Sicario</li>
          <li>Whiplash</li>
          <li>La La Land</li>
          <li>Dune: Parts 1 and 2</li>
        </ul>
        These are not all, I like way more movies, but these are some that come to my mind.
      </li>
      <li> I enjoy video games such as Minecraft and Fortnite, as well as horror games (especially on Roblox), and more recently, Cities Skylines and Hearts of Iron 4. </li>
      <li> I am also a big fan on writing stuff on LaTeX.</li>
    </ul>
