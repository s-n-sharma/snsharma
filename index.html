        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sidharth Sharma, but I mostly go by Sid. I am an undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Engineering Physics (EP) at UC Berkeley. Currently, my interests are very broad; I think I am interested in almost every area of EECS.</p>
        <p>At Berkeley, I have mainly worked at the Berkeley Wireless Research Center, where I work on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and high performance computing. Lately, I've become more interested in CS theory.</p>
        <p>Outside of academics, I'm interested in filmaking and cinematography, hiking, and reading up on history.  </p>
