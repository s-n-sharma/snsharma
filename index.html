  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is s-n-sharma. I am a undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) and Engineering Physics (EP).
    Currently, my interests are very broad; I think I am interested in almost each area of EECS.   </p> <br>
    <p>Currently, I mostly listen to (alternative/indie) rock, with my most-listened bands being The Strokes and Radiohead.</p>
    <p>I am also a big fan of writing stuff on LaTeX.</p>
