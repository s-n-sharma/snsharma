  <h3>My First Post!</h3>
  <p><b>Date:</b> July 16, 2025</p>
  <p>This is the first entry in my new blog. It's exciting to have a little corner of the internet to call my own. I built this entire site using just HTML, which has been a fun and nostalgic experience. It reminds me of the early days of the web, when things were much simpler.</p>
