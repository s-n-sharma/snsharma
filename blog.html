  <h3>My First Post and thoughts on my website</h3>
  <p><b>Date:</b> July 16, 2025</p>
  <p>My first blog post. My website is very bare-bones. I prefer this as it's clean and minimal, with no useless junk. Maybe I will update how it looks later on.  </p>

  <h3> A review of classes I have taken this past year </h3>
  <p><b> Date:</b> July 17, 2025 </p>
  <p> In my freshman year at Cal, I have taken interesting classes. I've decided to write a bit on each class as a way to remember some of the things that happened. Obviously, my opinions and views are only mine, and as such, are very biased and limited.  </p>
	<ul>
		<li> <b> Physics 5B </b> 
          <b> Difficulty </b>: 2/10
          <b> In 5 words: Interesting, fun, easy </b>

    </li>
