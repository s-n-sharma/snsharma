  <h3>My First Post and thoughts on my website</h3>
  <p><b>Date:</b> July 16, 2025</p>
  <p>My first blog post. My website is very bare-bones. I prefer this as it's clean and minimal, with no useless junk. Maybe I will update how it looks later on.  </p>

  <h3> A review of classes I have taken this past year </h3>
  <p><b> Date:</b> July 17, 2025 </p>
  <p> In my freshman year at Cal, I have taken interesting classes. I've decided to write a bit on each class as a way to remember some of the things that happened. Obviously, my opinions and views are only mine, and as such, are very biased and limited.  </p>
	<ul>
		<li> <b> Physics 5B:  Honors Introductory Electromagnetism, Waves, and Optics </b> <br>
          <b> Difficulty </b>: 2/10 <br>
          <b> In 5 words: Interesting, fun, easy </b> <br>
          This class is amazing. Professor Orenstein is an amazing lecturer; he goes at a speed that feels slow, but is actually pretty fast! 
          As a disclaimer, I did enter this class with a very significant amount of knowledge about E&M. The 5-series at Berkeley is more focused
          on theory, and as such, prepares one better for physics upperdivs. I felt that 5B is a must-take if you are a freshman who has taken Calculus III 
          and have some experience in E&M. I would also say this class is perfect for anyone who has aims to do anything EE-related. Homeworks were short, 
          roughly 4-5 problems from Purcell and Morin, but at the end of the class, when it gets more into optics, Prof. Orenstein gave his own problems.
          I have very fond memories of this class; many times, I would come and just absorb the new physics (especially the optics part) that he was teaching. 
          I also learned the trick to solve many differential equations: just guess e^{i k dot r - omega t}.

    </li>

    <li> <b> Physics 5BL: Honors Introduction to Experimental Physics I</b> <br>
    <b> Difficulty: </b> 8/10 </b> <br>
    <b> In 5 words: Intense, unforgiving, trauma-inducing, nightmare-inducing, worth-it</b>
    The hardest class I've taken so far. It maybe only 2 units, but this class took up most of my time. Grading is often unforgiving, and deadlines approach
    very fast. The first 1.5 months the class moves at break-neck speed. We would do labs on Tuesday, and by Thursday, we'd have to submit
    a lab report, written in LaTeX, that was often longer than 20 pages, along with hundreds of lines of code for data analysis. After the initial sprint,
    the class slows down a bit, before becoming insane the last 3 weeks. During that time, we worked on our capstone project. As a word of advice,
    do not pick a capstone project that does not have a clear aim or one that is very difficult. Our initial project was to build a radio transmitter
    and reciever, but despite hours and hours in lab, we weren't able to get it to work. Last minute, we started working on analog filters,
    but that too was not much easier. One of my partners had to spend 8 hours a day for a week and a half in the EECS16B labs trying to build 
    the high-order filters. Instead of studying for my final exams, I was working on the report, which, in the end, totaled over 50 pages. We wrote
    something on the order of a thousand lines of code for data analysis. The saving grace about the capstone project is that you are in a group
    of three, instead of two. I barely made out with an A in this class. I still think that this class is a must-take. It really "whips" you
    into shape for Berkeley, and it taught me how to actually code in Python with NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and other libraries. It might have
    been a bad idea to take it so early, however, but I met some of my closest friends through this class. This class also gives you knowledge
    that is very useful in EE classes, particularly EECS 16B.
