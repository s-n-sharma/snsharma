  <h3>My Favorite Drink these past several months</h3>
  <p><b>Date:</b> July 26, 2025</p>
  <p>I have been drinking this almost religiously these past couple months. I think it is amazing. It is a simple banana milkshake. Here
    is what I put in it:
    <ul>
      <li>4-5 cups of milk</li>
      <li>2 dates</li>
      <li>2 bannanas</li>
      <li>1/2-1 teaspoon of kewda water</li>
    </ul>
    I blend it all together. Depending on the ripeness of the bannanas, I add less or more milk and dates. The kewda water also adds a 
    nice hint of flavor, but it is important not to put too much and overpower everything else. I drink this every single day.
