                <i>IT: Welcome to Derry</i> (<i>WtD</i> for the rest of this blog) was the first show I finished in 2026. I thought it was really good. I generally
                don't watch too many horror movies/shows; I find most of them insanely terrifying and I start screaming. I definitely
                got scared while watching this show. I felt like it was a refresher from <i>Stranger Things</i>, which was good,
                but I really missed the Season 1 vibes, where the show felt like it was more horror and mystery. I feel like horror shows are more 
                scary than horror movies. For me, the most scary parts are at the start of whatever phenomeon is taking place, and when 
                the cause is revealed and sort of personified, the movie/show loses some of that mystery. TV shows, from what I've seen, due to their longer runtime,
                have a longer "phenomeon start" phase. <i>WtD</i> incorporated history well, and the storyline was 
                pretty good. I want to write more about the show, but I don't want to give any spoilers. Hopefully, I watch more horror movies in 2026. Highly recommend the show.
